# Info
These are my personal projects along with work from others done for the First Robotics Competition team 3407. Official code can be found here: https://github.com/FRC3407

# Organization
- Projects are first organized by year, if that year is completed, otherwise the projects from the current year are not. 
- From 2021 onward, Projects consist of a "Sloppy Copy", or just a project with all subsystems and commands working, and a project designated for the challenge of that year. 
- Other projects may consist of tests or other things from that year. 

# 3rd Party Libraries
3rd party libs will need to be installed separately, at least atm. These can be installed via an online link or manual download and install (Install info can be found on vendor websites or from https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/vscode-overview/3rd-party-libraries.html).
